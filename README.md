# dataeng-studies
This repo is a collection of data engineering simple projects where I can practice some concepts and study engineering tools.

So far I've got:


- **alura_apache_beam**: practing ETL with apache beam and python

- **flask_api**: practicing REST APIs using Flask

- **hackerrank**:
    - **plus_minus**: Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.
    - **min_max_sum**: Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

- **functional_programming**
